## Validates AAA Server exists
description: >
  All accounts used for access to the network device are privileged or system-level accounts.
  Therefore, if account management functions are not automatically enforced, an attacker could
  gain privileged access to a vital element of the network security architecture. The use of
  Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting (AAA) affords the best methods for controlling
  user access, authorization levels, and activity logging. By enabling AAA on the routers in
  conjunction with an authentication server such as TACACS+ or RADIUS, the administrators can
  easily add or remove user accounts, add or remove command authorizations, and maintain a log
  of user activity. The use of an authentication server provides the capability to assign device
  administrators to tiered groups that contain their privilege level, which is used for authorization
  of specific commands. This control does not include emergency administration accounts that
  provide access to the network device components in case of network failure. There must be only
  one such locally defined account. All other accounts must be defined. All other accounts must be
  created and managed on the site's authentication server (e.g., RADIUS, LDAP, or Active Directory).
  This requirement is applicable to account management functions provided by the network device.
