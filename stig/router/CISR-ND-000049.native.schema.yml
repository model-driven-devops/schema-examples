description: >
  Authentication for administrative (privileged level) access to the device is required at all times.
  An account can be created on the device's local database for use in an emergency, such as when the
  authentication server is down or connectivity between the device and the authentication server is
  not operable. This account is also referred to as the account of last resort since the emergency
  administration account is strictly intended to be used only as a last resort and immediate
  administrative access is absolutely necessary. The number of emergency administration accounts is
  restricted to at least one, but no more than operationally required as determined by the ISSO.
  The emergency administration account logon credentials must be stored in a sealed envelope and
  kept in a safe.
