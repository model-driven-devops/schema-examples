  This requirement supports non-repudiation of actions taken by an administrator and is required in order to
  maintain the integrity of the configuration management process. All configuration changes to the network
  device are logged, and administrators authenticate with two-factor authentication before gaining administrative
  access. Together, these processes will ensure the administrators can be held accountable for the configuration
  changes they implement. To meet this requirement, the network device must log administrator access and activity.
