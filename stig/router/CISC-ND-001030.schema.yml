description: >
  The loss of connectivity to a particular authoritative time source will result in the loss of time
  synchronization (free-run mode) and increasingly inaccurate time stamps on audit events and other
  functions. Multiple time sources provide redundancy by including a secondary source. Time synchronization
  is usually a hierarchy; clients synchronize time to a local source while that source synchronizes its
  time to a more accurate source. The network device must utilize an authoritative time server and/or
  be configured to use redundant authoritative time sources. This requirement is related to the comparison
  done in CCI-001891. DoD-approved solutions consist of a combination of a primary and secondary time
  source using a combination or multiple instances of the following: a time server designated for the
  appropriate DoD network (NIPRNet/SIPRNet); United States Naval Observatory (USNO) time servers;
  and/or the Global Positioning System (GPS). The secondary time source must be located in a different
  geographic region than the primary time source.
