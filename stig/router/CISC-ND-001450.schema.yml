  The aggregation of log data kept on a syslog server can be used to detect attacks
  and trigger an alert to the appropriate security personnel. The stored log data
  can used to detect weaknesses in security that enable the network IA team to find
  and address these weaknesses before breaches can occur. Reviewing these logs, whether
  before or after a security breach, are important in showing whether someone is an
  internal employee or an outside threat.
# This schema validates oc-system settings contain at least one logging server.
