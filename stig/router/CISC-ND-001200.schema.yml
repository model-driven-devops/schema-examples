description: >
  Unapproved mechanisms that are used for authentication to the cryptographic module are not verified
  and therefore cannot be relied upon to provide confidentiality or integrity, and DoD data may be
  compromised. Nonlocal maintenance and diagnostic activities are those activities conducted by
  individuals communicating through a network, either an external network (e.g., the Internet) or an
  internal network. Currently, HMAC is the only FIPS-approved algorithm for generating and verifying
  message/data authentication codes in accordance with FIPS 198-1. Products that are FIPS 140-2
  validated will have an HMAC that meets specification; however, the option must be configured for
  use as the only message authentication code used for authentication to cryptographic modules.
