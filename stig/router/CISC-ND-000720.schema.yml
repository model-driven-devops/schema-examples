 Terminating an idle session within a short time period reduces the window of opportunity for unauthorized
 personnel to take control of a management session enabled on the console or console port that has been
 left unattended. In addition, quickly terminating an idle session will also free up resources committed
 by the managed network element. Terminating network connections associated with communications sessions
 includes, for example, de-allocating associated TCP/IP address/port pairs at the operating system level,
 or de-allocating networking assignments at the application level if multiple application sessions are
 using a single, operating system-level network connection. This does not mean that the device terminates
 all sessions or network access; it only ends the inactive session and releases the resources associated
 with that session.
