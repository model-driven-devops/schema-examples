description: >
  Reconstruction of harmful events or forensic analysis is not possible if audit records do not contain enough
  information. Organizations consider limiting the additional audit information to only that information
  explicitly needed for specific audit requirements. The additional information required is dependent on the
  type of information (i.e., sensitivity of the data and the environment within which it resides). At a minimum,
  the organization must audit full-text recording of privileged commands. The organization must maintain audit
  trails in sufficient detail to reconstruct events to determine the cause and impact of compromise.
