description: >
  STP is implemented on bridges and switches to prevent Layer 2 loops when a broadcast domain
  spans multiple bridges and switches and when redundant links are provisioned to provide high
  availability in case of link failures. Convergence time can be significantly reduced using
  Rapid STP (802.1w) instead of STP (802.1d), resulting in improved availability. Rapid STP
  should be deployed by implementing either Rapid Per-VLAN-Spanning-Tree (Rapid-PVST) or
  Multiple Spanning-Tree Protocol (MSTP). The latter scales much better when there are many
  VLANs.
